        From a point of view a website, just like any other application, does two things: show data and keeps data updated.

Data can be everything: non obvious examples include the website title, or articles, or supported languages. More obvious examples are the number of users, their access credentials, or the results of a poll. There are also a lot of “hidden” examples, like the number of views, or how they reached the website. This information, if the company is big enough, is later moved to more specialized databases/data technologies, and aggregated to produce statistics that are useful for business.

Sometimes data are not stored in a database. For example, the texts you see in a website could be written statically in the website templates. But the most logical place to store and elaborate data is a database.

Note that data can also be written to and retrieved from other types of technologies. For example, caches, that can serve frequently accessed data very quickly. Or message brokers, that can temporarily store data to process and gradually send them to the processor. Sometimes, these technologies are also called databases - and this could be correct, I don’t have any strong opinions about this. But anyway, behind them, there is a more “traditional” (or “general purpose”) database, which is usually SQL. The reason is that only such databases are designed to make data consistent, while other specialized technologies can serve other purpose concerning some specific usage of data.

Why SQL and not NoSQL? Well, sometimes only NoSQL is used actually. But NoSQL technologies, in general, are not designed to provide strong consistency guarantees, and they are more about specific tasks.

I oversimplified here and there, because SQL and NoSQL are very generic categories, and technologies don’t always follow exactly these general rules.
